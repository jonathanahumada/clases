* Preambulo

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A Linux distribution consists of the components needed to create a working Linux system and the procedures needed to get those components installed and running.
 Technically, Linux is really just what is referred to as the kernel.
 Before the kernel can be useful, you must have other software such as basic commands (GNU utilities),
 services you want to offer (such as remote login or web servers), and possibly a desktop interface and graphical applications.
 Then, you must be able to gather all that together and install it on your computer’s hard disk.

** Entra en escena Red Hat
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Before long, many other Linux distributions were created.
 Some Linux distributions were created to meet special needs, such as KNOPPIX (a live CD Linux), Gentoo (a cool customizable Linux), and Mandrake (later called Mandriva, which was one of several desktop Linux distributions).
 But two major distributions rose to become the foundation for many other distributions: Red Hat Linux and Debian.

*** Razones
- RPM: cambia el paradigma de archivos comprimidos a archivos con metadatos (local RPM database, removerlo, atualizarlo, etc)
- Simple installation: "As a user, you could step through some simple questions, in most cases accepting defaults, to install Red Hat Linux."
- Graphical administration: se podía utilizar sin necesidad de hacer comandos.

ready-to-run versions of Red Hat Linux (referred to as the binaries).
 But as the needs of their Linux community users and big-ticket customers began to move further apart,
 Red Hat abandoned Red Hat Linux and began developing two operating systems instead: Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora

Using Fedora
While RHEL is the commercial, stable, supported Linux distribution, Fedora is the free, cutting-edge Linux distribution that is sponsored by Red Hat, Inc.
 Fedora is the Linux system Red Hat uses to engage the Linux development community and encourage those who want a free Linux for personal use.
Fedora includes more than 16,000 software packages, many of which keep up with the latest available open source technology.
 As a user, you can try the latest Linux desktop, server, and administrative interfaces in Fedora for free. As a software developer, you can create and test your applications using the latest Linux kernel and development tools.
Because the focus of Fedora is on the latest technology, it focuses less on stability.
 So expect that you might need to do some extra work to get everything working and that not all the software will be fully baked.
However, I recommend that you use Fedora for most of the examples in this book for the following reasons:

When the Linux kernel tries to decide which running processes get access to the CPUs on your system,
 one of the things it takes into account is the nice value set on the process.
 Every process running on your system has a nice value between –20 and 19. 
By default, the nice value is set to 0. Here are a few facts about nice values:
