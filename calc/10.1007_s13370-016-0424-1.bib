abstract="Very often, in physical exercises, it is necessary to differentiate an integral with respect to a parameter. Generally we differentiate after the integral evaluation but, occasionally, it is desirable, from theoretical point of view, to interchange the order of differentiation and integration. In this letter, we examine in a simple way the derivative under the flux integral getting the result in a very simple manner that could be useful from didactic point of view.",
