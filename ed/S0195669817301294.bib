abstract = "We propose a new linear-size data structure which provides a fast access to all palindromic substrings of a string or a set of strings. This structure inherits some ideas from the construction of both the suffix trie and suffix tree. Using this structure, we present simple and efficient solutions for a number of problems involving palindromes."
